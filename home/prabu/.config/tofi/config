    padding-left = 17

	# Whether to clip text drawing to be within the specified padding. This
	# is mostly important for allowing text to be inset from the border,
	# while still allowing text backgrounds to reach right to the edge.
	# clip-to-padding = true
    clip-to-padding = False

	# Whether to scale the window by the output's scale factor.
	scale = true


#
### Window positioning
#
	# The name of the output to appear on. An empty string will use the
	# default output chosen by the compositor.
	output = ""

	# Location on screen to anchor the window to.
	#
	# Supported values: top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right,
	# bottom, bottom-left, left, center.
	anchor = center

	# Set the size of the exclusive zone.
	#
	# A value of -1 means ignore exclusive zones completely.
	# A value of 0 will move tofi out of the way of other windows' zones.
	# A value greater than 0 will set that much space as an exclusive zone.
	#
	# Values greater than 0 are only meaningful when tofi is anchored to a
	# single edge.
	exclusive-zone = -1

	# Window offset from edge of screen. Only has an effect when anchored
	# to the relevant edge. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	margin-top = 0
	margin-bottom = 0
	margin-left = 0
	margin-right = 0

#
### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the mouse cursor.
	# hide-cursor = false
	# Show a text cursor in the input field.
	# text-cursor = false
	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Specify an alternate file to read and store history information
	# from / to. This shouldn't normally be needed, and is intended to
	# facilitate the creation of custom modes.
	# history-file = /path/to/histfile

    # Use fuzzy matching for searches. If true, searching is performed
    # via a simple fuzzy matching algorithm. If false, substring
    # matching is used, weighted to favour matches closer to the
    # beginning of the string.
    fuzzy-match = false

    # If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
    # In drun mode, this is always true.
	# require-match = true
    # require-match = False
	# If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
	# remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
	# skipped altogether.
	auto-accept-single = false

	# If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
	# anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.
	hide-input = false

	# Replace displayed input characters with a character. If the empty
	# string is given, input will be completely hidden.
	# This option only has an effect when hide-input is set to true.
	# hidden-character = "*"

    # If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
    # Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
    # If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
    # Otherwise, just print the Exec line of the .desktop file to stdout.
    drun-launch = false
    # The terminal to run terminal programs in when in drun mode.
	# This option has no effect if drun-launch is set to true.
	# Defaults to the value of the TERMINAL environment variable.
	# terminal = foot

	# Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
	# This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
	# for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
	# performance on slow systems.
	late-keyboard-init = false

	# If true, allow multiple simultaneous processes.
	# If false, create a lock file on startup to prevent multiple instances
	# from running simultaneously.
	multi-instance = false

	# Assume input is plain ASCII, and disable some Unicode handling
	# functions. This is faster, but means e.g. a search for "e" will not
	# match "Ã©".
	ascii-input = false

#
### Text cursor theme
#
	# Style of the optional text cursor.
	#
	# Supported values: bar, block, underscore
	# text-cursor-style = bar

	# Color of the text cursor
	#
	# If unspecified, defaults to the same as input-color
	# text-cursor-color = #FFFFFF

	# Color of text behind the text cursor when text-cursor-style = block
	#
	# If unspecified, defaults to the same as background-color
	# text-cursor-background = #000000

	# Corner radius of the text cursor
	# text-cursor-corner-radius = 0


	# Thickness of the bar and underscore text cursors.
	#
	# If unspecified, defaults to a font-dependent value when
	# text-cursor-style = underscore, or to 2 otherwise.
	# text-cursor-thickness = 2

### Inclusion
#
	# Configs can be split between multiple files, and then included
	# within each other.
	# include = /path/to/config
